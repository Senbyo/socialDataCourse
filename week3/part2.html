        <h3>Excercise: Some questions for the video.</h3>
        <li><h4>Mention 10 examples of ways we can encode data</h4></li>
          <p>
            Length, Size, Position, Pattern, Shape, brightness, color hue, orientation, angle, and line weight.
          </p>
        <li><h4>Are all encoding created equally? Why not?</h4></li>
          <p>
            No they are not. Some will reveal some aspects of the code while other will reveal other aspects.
          </p>
        <li><h4>Explain in your own words: What is the problem with pie-charts?</h4></li>
          <p>
            We are pretty bad at estimating areas of shapes, such as areas under the curve, and a pie chart is all about comparing the size of an area with the size of another area. The same goes  for angles in pie-charts. It is hard for us to correctly estimate angles ,and because this is a hard task for us, it leads to  high chances of errors when analyzing a pie-chart that have parts that are roughly the same size. 
          </p>
        <li><h4>Mention three encodings that are difficult for the human eye to parse? Can you find an example of a visualization online that uses one of those three?</h4></li>
          <p>
            Area of circles compared to each other.<br>
            Angles between pie slices in a pie-chart.<br>
            The area under the curve of a kernel density function.<br>
            Color intensity or small changes in hue.
          </p>
        <li><h4>What is a "Choropleth"? What does the ancient Greek root of that word "χῶρος" mean?</h4></li>
          <p>
            Choropleth is a map where you have some shape files that are color coded according to the data.
            The greek mening of Choropleth is χῶρος (area/region) + πλῆθος (multitude.
