      <h5>This is Quantifiably the Best Month to go to the Farmers Market</h5>


      <p style="text-align:center;padding-bottom: 50px;padding-top: 80px;border:0px;">As part of a homework assignment, I ask my students at Pratt to go out and chart something of interest to them, and Katherine Savarese came back with a simple chart about farmers markets that I loved- it inspired this post.

      You probably know that farmers markets are a staple across all five boroughs of New York City, but September happens to be a very special month. Why is that?  Well, it turns out September is the month with the most unique types of fresh produce- forty three to be exact.

      To show the current offerings, we charted how many types of fruits and vegetables are available by month,
      and showed if they were fresh or from storage. </p>

      <div id="plot"> </div>
      <button class="button filter" onclick="stackedAndGrouped([3, 2, 1, 0])">
          <span>Stacked/Grouped</span>
      </button>
      <button class="button filter" onclick="changeGraph(0)">
          <span>Fresh Fruit</span>
      </button>
      <button class="button filter" onclick="changeGraph(2)">
          <span>Fresh Vege.</span>
      </button>
      <button class="button filter" onclick="changeGraph(1)">
          <span>Storage Fruit</span>
      </button>
      <button class="button filter" onclick="changeGraph(3)">
          <span>Storage Vege.</span>
      </button>
      </br>    </br>
    </br>

      <p style="text-align:center;padding-top: 50px;padding-bottom: 25px;border:0px;">
        If you miss the month of September, you might be behind the fruit curve,
        but there are plenty more months of vegetables left.
        The chart shows that fresh vegetables are available 9 out of 12 months,
        but fruit is only available 5 out of 12.
        Now if only we could quantify how delicious the produce isâ€¦
