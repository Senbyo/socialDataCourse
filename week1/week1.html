-Name 7 common HTML elements.
	HTML elements are the tags used to mark up the content. 7 common ones are
	<html> <head> <body> <p> <a> <h1> <div>


-What's the difference between the class and the id HTML attributes.
	The difference lies in the fact that there ids are unique for each DOM/HTML document.
	Meaning that only one element can have a given ID. Furthermore IDs cannot start with
	numerals. An element can only have one id
	Classes on the other hand can be used to class different elements together. And elements
	can be part of several classes.
	Meaning that IDs are unique and classes are not.

-What does "DOM" stand for? Explain in your own word what it refers to.
	DOM stands for Document Object Model. it referes to the hierarchy of a HTML page.
	Further more it defines the relationship of different elements within this HTML page.
	This relationship is defined through the use of parent, child, sibling etc.

-What Python structure does the array correspond to?
	This corresponds to a Python list.

-Which Python container does object correspond to?
	This corresponds to a Python dictionary.

-Consider the 5 SVG squares in example 3-22. Think about how you'd:
	-Add a gray boundary of width 2.
		add a stroke with the color gray and set the stroke-width to 2.

	-Make the squares increasingly transparant from left to right.
		Because of the added stroke using an rgba color instead of rgb would be bothersome
		if both square and boundary should have the same transparency, and because of that
		adding an opacity element to the squares would do the trick. This requires values
		between 0(transparent) to 1(opaque). An example could be 1, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, 0.10.

	-Make the squares 80 by 80 instead of 30 by 30.
		set width and height to 80 instead of 30. As well as moving the the center of the squares
		accordingly. One could say that 80 is 30 increased by a factor of 2.66, and use this as a
		factor on the center x,y as well as increasing the size of the SVG elements height with 
		the same factor.

	-Make the squares go from bottom of the SVG element to the top instead of the other way around.
		I would simply reverse the order that the elements are defined in.
