            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <!--What is your dataset?

            Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)
          -->

            <p>The dataset that was used for this assignment tracks the spread of terrorism across Europe. It was derived from
                a dataset on global terrorism found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd">www.kaggle.com</a>, that tracks
                terror attacks across the globe. <\br>
                Our Terrorism in Europe dataset has approximately 22000 records (terrorism attacks), spanning 46 years. It contains every
                attack carried out and formally recorded, regardless of success, from the 1970s to 2016. To provide more context to the reader,
                1970s were the decade that started with Assad (the current ruling regime in Syria) taking power through a coup(1970), the US withdrawal from
                the unpopular Vietnam war(1974) and Saddam Hussein beginning to rise in power. It ended with the Iranian Revolution(1979) that turned Iran from a
                pro-Western progressive counrty to a theocracy. Even more noteworthy was the so called "Skyjack Sunday"(1970), where Palestinian terrorists hijacked
                four airliners and took
                over 300 people on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up. This event marked
                beginning of modern rebellious fighting and terrorism as we know it.</br>
                As such, the 70s can be considered the trigger-point for many of the current woes that plague the west and a natural starting point to a
                narrative about the rise of modern terrorism.

              <!--What was your goal for the end userâ€™s experience?-->
              <!--mention martini?-->
            <p>
              Our goal for the end users' experience would be to provide a "Martini glass" structure, where we start on a rigid, author-driven path which gives
              readers the time they need to familiarize themselves with our notation, colours and tools (choropleths/graphs). Then, we gradually pass more and more
              control to the user, ending up allowing them to take full control over the process and individually explore our dataset.

             </ul>

             Preprocessing done on this dataset includes the classical null-value replacement in the field Victims with 0 and Group, Target and Weapon type with Unknown.
             All the attacks had coordinates associated with them, along with Country and Region. A problem, though, was that since the 1970s some of the countries (Yugoslavia, for example)
             did not exist any longer and others had their borders changed. As such, we had to cross-reference each country with the coordinates.
             Another issue was that excessive data handling in javascript (given the size of our dataset) resulted in noticable delays. As such,
             we agreed to generally sacrifice space for speed and made a number of different grouped-up(binned) versions of our data to be used with
             our different illustrations. The stacked area graph, for example, uses a version of our dataset where each year is composed of 5 rows, the
             activity of the four most active groups and the total activity. The features of this dataset were the types of attack. This encoding allowed us to
             encode a 21000-row,19 columns dataset into 236 rows and 12 columns. Information was, of course, lost in the transition but the dataset worked wonders with optimizing
             our stacked area graph. </br>
             Another issue that we should mention here was the missing data for 1993. This was a problem of the original dataset (probably some corruption on their records) and it was not a problem
             we could do anything from our part to fix.
             All pre-processing was done in python and can be found in the git-repository.

              </figure>

              Figure 1 illustrates the number of terror attacks over the years in Europe. The first spike in activity, in 1979, is mostly caused mostly by the activity of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and ETA (Basque Fatherland and Freedom), that operated mostly within Spain(the Basque regions).
              The second spike in activity, in 1992, was caused by those same groups along with Neo-Nazi extremists and a high number of unkown assailants. The final spike in activity, in 2014, was caused mostly by unknown assailants and two Ukrainian groups, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR). For reference,
              ISIS and ISIS-inspired militants have carried out a grand total of 47 attacks since it formed (1999). DPR alone carried out 330 attacks in 2014 alone.
              Clearly, all organizations take human lives and have an immense negative impact on society. But the impact of the most deadly of them, though, is ridiculously disproportionate to the media coverage they receive.
              On the other hand, organizations that receive the most coverage (ISIS) actually have a presence that pales in comparison to the five most active organizations, even when taking into account only data from 2014 and later (44 ISIS and ISIS-inspired attacks as opposed to 613 attacks from DPR-only).
              And when taking into account the impact of organizations since the 1970s, DPR is not even in the top-3 as can be seen in Figure 2.

            Figure 3 shows an interesting pattern, namely that Russia and Ukraine are the only countries with more people killed than wounded and France
            an outstanding example of a lower than average killed-to-wounded ratio.

            Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?-->
            <p>The genre that we felt would better serve to tell the story of terror in Europe would be borrowing elements from both Annotated Map
            and a Slide Show (much like the Afghanistan: Behind the front line visualization)<a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf">[1]</a>.
            More specifically, we're using the same map over multiple "slides" and annotate it differently on each slide to tell each part of the story.
            </p>
            <h4>Visual Narrative</h4>
            <p>Our story begins with an Establishing Shot, a basic Choropleth of Europe with minimal information on it. This is in-line with the Martini glass-type of structure we're aiming for,
            as it sets the stage, work nicely with a more author-driven initial experience
            and is a natural starting point for a Consistent Visual Platform, the other structuring tool we used.
            Familiar Objects (which makes sence given the Consistent Visual Platform) and a constant Viewing Angle help to solidify the position of the user
            and bring attention to the ever changing details on the graphs. As such, Motion was used for highlighting mostly in the form of transitions in D3.
            Continuity Editing via Animated Transitions is, thus, the cornerstone of our approach and the building blocks of our story.
            </p>
            <h4>Narative Structure</h4>
            <p>To create a martini glass structure, we employeed a User Directed Path that encourages rather than enforces an initial linear path through the ordering of the tabs.
            Interactivity is vital part of this process and at the heart of the course. We used Hover Highlighting to display information on labels and attacks along with
            brushes to filter the timeline (Filtering). Furthermore, tabs can be considered Navigation(pagination) Buttons.
            Finally, classic messaging tools such as captions, annotations and text were used to mark and explain interesting parts of our story.

            choropleth, first alone for intro, then accompanied by timeline and stacked chart for breakdown of types of attacks used in time along with group responsible for percentage of these attacks.

            Why are they right for the story you want to tell?-->
            <p>Due to the geographical nature of our dataset, a choropleth would be the natural choice to base a data-driven story on.
            A timeline tied into the choropleth, with a brush to filter, adds a lot of intuitive control over the process and allows for flexible, personal exploration.
            But in our case, this was only part of the story as the type of attack was not touched at all. A stacked flowchart is a great tool for allowing a user
            insight into the evolution of each type of attack over the years and a breakdown of each of those types to the groups mostly utilizing it over each period of time.
            These visualizations build a decent, subjective, data-driven picture of how terrorism in all its forms, as carried out by different groups, evolved and spread throughout Europe.
            It is, also, naturally able to fit within the Martini glass structure and the Continuity Editing tool, as the base of our story, the choropleth, is unchanged and everything else
            simply adds to the story/interactability.

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <!--What went well?

            What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?
            went well: reusing SVG elemtents, like hidding circles instead of redrawing them and hidding stacks in the stacked graph instead of adding/removing.
            we change the timeline update to be on release instead of update, which saves a lot of computations and allows us to use such a big dataset. The colors used
            are the same throughout, for consistency.
            missing: tacit tutorial, text, more aggressive performance, 1993 missing data
            -->
            This was a very interesting and relevant dataset to work with. It's size meant that we had to employ certain domain-specific measures to keep
            the illustrations peformant and we believe the end result to be successful in that regard. We encoded the dataset in different ways to accomodate the needs
            of each illustration and re-used the SVG elements instead of reloading them constantly (for example we rendered the circles on the map once and faded them in-out instead
            of redrawing them constantly). Also, colors and illustrations were kept relevant and matching throughout the story, to make it consistent and in-line with
            our chosen visual narrative tools.</br>
            Missing features that we would very much like to include would be a tacit tutorial, as they are doing a great job at kicking-off interactive stories. Problems we faced with
            integrating text in svg elements (had to do with the version of d3 we worked on) prevented us from doing it. While we believe we did well on managing
            the performance of the illustrations, there was still room for more aggressive data encapsulation. Finally, the original dataset had a problem with missing data.
            The entire 1993 is missing, something that we could do nothing about from our end. Finally we shoul mention that we intended to implement an alluvial chart along with
            the stacked graph. We realized, though, that the information conveyed by the two were the same in our case and so having them both would be redundant. As the
            stacked flowchart is cleaner-looking and more intuitive, we decided on using that.
