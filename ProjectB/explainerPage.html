            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <!--What is your dataset?

            Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)
          -->

            <p>The dataset that was used for this assignment tracks the spread of terrorism across Europe. It was derived from
                a dataset on global terrorism found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd">www.kaggle.com</a>, that tracks
                terror attacks across the globe. <\br>
                Our Terrorism in Europe dataset has approximately 22000 records (terrorism attacks), spanning 46 years. It contains every
                attack carried out and formally recorded, regardless of success, from the 1970s to 2016. To provide more context to the reader,
                1970s were the decade that started with Assad (the current ruling regime in Syria) taking power through a coup(1970), the US withdrawal from
                the unpopular Vietnam war(1974) and Saddam Hussein beginning to rise in power. It ended with the Iranian Revolution(1979) that turned Iran from a
                pro-Western progressive counrty to a theocracy. Even more noteworthy was the so called "Skyjack Sunday"(1970), where Palestinian terrorists hijacked
                four airliners and took
                over 300 people on board as hostage. The hostages were later released, but the planes were blown up. This event marked
                beginning of modern rebellious fighting and terrorism as we know it.</br>
                As such, the 70s can be considered the trigger-point for many of the current woes that plague the west and a natural starting point to a
                narrative about the rise of modern terrorism.

              <!--What was your goal for the end user’s experience?-->
              <!--mention martini?-->
            <p>
              Our goal for the end users' experience would be to provide a "Martini glass" structure, where we start on a rigid, author-driven path which gives
              readers the time they need to familiarize themselves with our notation, colours and tools (choropleths/graphs). Then, we gradually pass more and more
              control to the user, ending up allowing them to take full control over the process and individually explore our dataset.

              </figure>

              Figure 1 illustrates the number of terror attacks over the years in Europe. The first spike in activity, in 1979, is mostly caused mostly by the activity of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and ETA (Basque Fatherland and Freedom), that operated mostly within Spain(the Basque regions).
              The second spike in activity, in 1992, was caused by those same groups along with Neo-Nazi extremists and a high number of unkown assailants. The final spike in activity, in 2014, was caused mostly by unknown assailants and two Ukrainian groups, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic (DPR and LPR). For reference,
              ISIS and ISIS-inspired militants have carried out a grand total of 47 attacks since it formed (1999). DPR alone carried out 330 attacks in 2014 alone.
              Clearly, all organizations take human lives and have an immense negative impact on society. But the impact of the most deadly of them, though, is ridiculously disproportionate to the media coverage they receive.
              On the other hand, organizations that receive the most coverage (ISIS) actually have a presence that pales in comparison to the five most active organizations, even when taking into account only data from 2014 and later (44 ISIS and ISIS-inspired attacks as opposed to 613 attacks from DPR-only).
              And when taking into account the impact of organizations since the 1970s, DPR is not even in the top-3 as can be seen in Figure 2.

            Figure 3 shows an interesting pattern, namely that Russia and Ukraine are the only countries with more people killed than wounded and France
            an outstanding example of a lower than average killed-to-wounded ratio.

            Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?-->
            <h4>Visual Narrative</h4>
            <p>Our story begins with an Establishing Shot, a basic Choropleth of Europe with minimal information on it. This is in-line with the Martini glass-type of structure we're aiming for,
            as it sets the stage, work nicely with a more author-driven initial experience
            and is a natural starting point for a Consistent Visual Platform, the other structuring tool we used.
            Familiar Objects (which makes sence given the Consistent Visual Platform) and a constant Viewing Angle help to solidify the position of the user
            and bring attention to the ever changing details on the graphs. As such, Motion was used for highlighting mostly in the form of transitions in D3.
            Continuity Editing via Animated Transitions is, thus, the cornerstone of our approach and the building blocks of our story.
            </p>
            <h4>Narative Structure</h4>
            <p>To create a martini glass structure, we employeed a User Directed Path that encourages rather than enforces an initial linear path through the ordering of the tabs.
            Interactivity is vital part of this process and at the heart of the course. We used Hover Highlighting to display information on labels and attacks along with
            brushes to filter the timeline (Filtering). Furthermore, tabs can be considered Navigation(pagination) Buttons.
            Finally, classic messaging tools such as captions, annotations and text were used to mark and explain interesting parts of our story.

            choropleth, first alone for intro, then accompanied by timeline and stacked chart for breakdown of types of attacks used in time along with group responsible for percentage of these attacks.

            Why are they right for the story you want to tell?-->
            <p>Due to the geographical nature of our dataset, a choropleth would be the natural choice to base a data-driven story on.
            A timeline tied into the choropleth, with a brush to filter, adds a lot of intuitive control over the process and allows for flexible, personal exploration.
            But in our case, this was only part of the story as the type of attack was not touched at all. A stacked flowchart is a great tool for allowing a user
            insight into the evolution of each type of attack over the years and a breakdown of each of those types to the groups mostly utilizing it over each period of time.
            These visualizations build a decent, subjective, data-driven picture of how terrorism in all its forms, as carried out by different groups, evolved and spread throughout Europe.
            It is, also, naturally able to fit within the Martini glass structure and the Continuity Editing tool, as the base of our story, the choropleth, is unchanged and everything else
            simply adds to the story/interactability.
