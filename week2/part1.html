			<li><h4>What is the difference between data and metadata? How does that relate to the bike-example?</h4></li>
				<p>
					    <i>Data</i> can simply be a piece of information, a list of measurements, or observations, a story or a description of a certain thing.
					    <br/>
					    <i>Metadata</i> specifies the relevant information about the data which helps in identifying the nature and feature of the data.
				</p>
			<li><h4>Sune says that the human eye is a great tool for data analysis. Do you agree? Explain why/why not. Mention something that the human eye is very good at. Can you think of something that is difficult for the human eye. Explain why your example is difficult. </h4></li>
				<p>
					Visual perseption has been a big topic in cognitive science, and has been researched a lot. One theory is that recognition starts with the identification of features. This coinsides well with the explanation of outlier detection from the lecture. When all the percieved object share a feature, except one that one sticks out. However when in the example where one has to locate waldo each visual object has a combination of features, and searching for a combination of features is significantly slower. Because of this we need to examine the image one person at the time to see if the features match those that define Waldo.
					<!-- Marc's answer. Don't know if it's useful as the answer above is pretty good. -->
					<!-- Sort of agreeing but the eye is only capturing the world as presented to use, whereas the brain is performing the complex “algorithms” for interpreting  the world as seen by the eye. -->

			<li><h4>Simpson's paradox is hard to explain. Come up with your own example - or find one on line.</h4></li>
				<p>
					One example of this, that is found on the Simpsons paradox wikipedia page, is a study of gender bias among graduate school admissions to Berkeley a university in Calefornia. The data showed a bias towards male students being accepted. However when the data was broken down into groups defined by the different departments it showed that in more departments were actually biased towards women then men, showing a small bias towards women.

			<li><h4>In your own words, explain the differnece between exploratory and explanatory data analysis. </h4></li>
				<p>
					<i>Exploratory</i> is about finding meaning in data.
					</br>
					<i>Explanatory</i> is about presenting the meaning from data.
				</p>
			<li><h4>As mentioned earlier, visualization is not the only way to test for correlation. We can (for example) calculate the Pearson correlation. Explain in your own words how the Pearson correlation works and write down it's mathematical formulation. Can you think of an example where it fails (and visualization works)?</h4></li>

					</br>
					The Pearson correlation fails, as shown in the picture, when data aren’t linear correlated.
				</p>
			<li><h4>What is the difference between a bar-chart and a histogram?</h4></li>
				<p>
					The main difference between bar charts and histograms. With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by a categorical variable; and with histograms, each column represents a group defined by a continuous, quantitative variable.
				</p>
			<li><h4>I mention in the video that it's important to choose the right bin-size in histograms. But how do you do that? Do a Google search to find a criterion you like and explain it. </h4></li>
				<p>
			    		Use Sturge’s Rule as a rule of thumb, as it has been criticised for over smoothing the plot.
