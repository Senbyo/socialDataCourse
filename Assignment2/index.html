				<h4>What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</h4>
				<p>
					The Oxford English Dictionary defines narrative as “an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.”

				<h4>What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.</h4>
				<p>Our favourite plot from section 3 is the <i>Steroids or Not, the Pursuit is On</i> plot. We like this plot for different reason. Some of which are the following. Even though there is no direct order in which the visualisation should be explored, the path is accomplished by using the appropriate visual highlighting. The visualisation also use the highlighting, such as colour, size and boldness, to make the reader focus on the important parts. Furthermore does the visualisation keep a consistent order both in colours and the names of the athletes, making it seemless for the reader to switch back and forth between the subsections of the visualisation, as it has been divided into.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What's the point of Figure 7?</h4>
				<p>The point of the plot is to give an overview of what genre, visual narrative and narrative structure is being used in plots. In other words it is possible to see if there are any trends in this.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).</h4>

				<h4>Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3.</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</h4>
						<p>Our favourite genre is the <i>Partitioned Poster</i>. One reason for this is that this genre allows one to break down the information that visualisation tried to convey into multiple plots.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>What is your least favorite genre? Why?</h4>
						<p>Our least favourite genre is the <i>Magazine Style</i>. One of the reasons why we do not like it, the visualisation is supporting the wall of text, rather than it being the text that supports that visualisation. Another thing is that visualisations in this genre is usually static visualisations.</p>

				The figures below visualise all recorded murders in the five boroughs of New York City in the period from 2006 to 2017.
				<br/>
				The first figure shows a timeline of all the recorded murders in the period and it is possible to filter in this timeline for a given time period.
				<br/>
				The second figure shows how the murders are distributed in the five boroughs of New York City and it is possible to mark a part of the map to filter a selection of murders.
				<br/>
				The third and final figure shows how the murders are distributed in the 24 hours of a day. Here it is also possible to select consecutive hours to narrow the selection even further.
