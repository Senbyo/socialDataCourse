		<h2>Part 1: Telling Data Stories</h2>

				<h4>What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</h4>
				<p>
					The Oxford English Dictionary defines narrative as “an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.”

				<h4>What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.</h4>
				<p>Our favourite plot from section 3 is the <ij>Steroids or Not, the Pursuit is On</ij> plot. We like this plot for a few different reasons. Even though there is no direct order in which the visualisation should be explored, a natural path is accomplished by using the appropriate visual highlighting. The visualisation also utilizes the highlighting, such as colour size and boldness, to make the reader focus on the important parts. Furthermore, the visualisation keeps a consistent order both in colours and the names of the athletes, making it seemless for the reader to switch back and forth between the subsections of the visualisation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What's the point of Figure 7?</h4>
				<p>The point of the plot is to give an overview of what genre, visual narrative and narrative structure
					is being used in plots and offer insigth into possible existing trends/patterns in the data.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</h4>
						<p>Our favourite genre is the <ij>Partitioned Poster</ij>. This genre allows one to break down the information
							conveyed by the visualisation into multiple plots, while not necessarily requiring a strict order to exist between them.
							These multi-view visualizations are often miss-used in practise, though, as people tend to overload them with information and plots,
							 ending up with a very hard to understand result.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>What is your least favorite genre? Why?</h4>
						<p>Our least favourite genre is the <ij>Magazine Style</ij>. One of the reasons why we do not like it is its inherent support of walls of text.
							Rather than having the figure complement the text, we prefer that text complements the visualizations. Another thing is
							 that visualisations based on this genre tend to be static to keep
						 the reader from being distracted from reading the text. That's not to say, though, that the genre itself is limited
						  in any way to being static but rather that it is frequently under-utilized. </p>

		<h2>Part 2: Visualizing Murders over Time</h2>
		<h3 style="text-align: center">Murders in the 5 boroughs of NYC</h3>
		<div style="text-align: center">
			<button class="button animate" onclick="animateTimeLine()">
				<span>Animate</span>
			</button>
		</div>
		<p style="text-align: center">
			The figures below visualise all recorded murders in the five boroughs of New York City in the period from 2006 to 2017.
			<br/>
			The first figure shows a timeline of all the recorded murders within this period and it is can be filtered.
			<br/>
			The second figure (map) demonstrates how the murders are distributed in the five boroughs of New York City. It is possible to mark
			a part of the map to filter-out a selection of murders, if needed.
			<br/>
			The third and final figure (barchart) shows how the 24-hour-distribution of murders for our (filtered) data. Filtering/sampling is also possible here by selecting only a subset of consecutive hours.
			The whole 24-hour spectrum is selected by default (drag the left-most or right-most side of the plot to adjust the selection).
