                    <h4>Who is Edward Tufte? (Go online and find his info), summarize in max 3 lines.</h4>
                    <p>
                         Edward Tufte is an American statistician who is an expert in presentation of informational graphics.

                    <h4>What is the "Lie Factor"?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Tufte has tried to described the Lie Factor with the following formula: (size of effect shown in graphic)/(size of effect in data) => keep near 1.
                    </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                    <h4>What's the idea behind the "Data-Inc ratio". Should it be maximized or minimized?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Tufte has again tried to describe the Data-Inc ratio with a formular: (data ink)/(total ink used to print graphic) => maximize. In essence this means that one should try to say as much as possible with as little ink as possible. A example of where people fail to do so is when, for a very simple data set, the visulization is clutered with animations, colours, borders, legends, different font size, type and style.
