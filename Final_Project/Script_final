For our final project we are going to look at data for terror attacks across Europe.
More specifically we are going to focus on and visualise any trends in
the data. We believe it is interesting to investigate how terrorism is performed
in different parts of Europe and how it has evolved through time.

The visualisations that we wish to create for the project is:
- a choropleth of Europe, showing the location of the terror attacks
- an areachart of the type of attack and the number of casualties
- an alluvial chart of location and type of attacks \footnote{https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html}

The visualisations are going to be presented such that the viewer have the
opportunity to start where it seems to be the most interesting to the viewer.
Each visualisation will have annotations associated to it, to lead the viewer
through one way of exploring the visualisation and thereby showing how it can be
narrowed down to more easily find interesting information from the data. These
characteristics correspond with the genres partitioned poster and annotated
chart.

Our implementation plan is as follows. First we are going to get the basic
functionality in all plots up and running. Then we will build a website with a
good synergy for the plots. This is followed by some styling of the website and
the plots to give them a uniform experience. Then we'll focus on improving the
user experience by making short paragraphs and tacit tutorials. The final part
will be to tweak the plots to make the user experience even nicer.
Slides:
- Get plots running with basic functionality
- Build website with good synergy
- Style website and plots to give uniform experience
- Increase user experience with paragraphs and tacit tutorials
- Final tweaking of the plots

For our exploratory data analysis, we have been looking at a dataset that tracks
terror attacks in the period of 1970-2016. In this period has about 22000
attacks been recorded. The data set has 18 variables, some of
which is location, attack type and victims.
